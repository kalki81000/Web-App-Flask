        "Flask templates are files that contain static or dynamic content written in HTML and optionally augmented with Jinja2 template engine syntax. These templates are used to generate dynamic HTML content in Flask web applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how Flask templates are typically used in web development:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Create Template Files**: Create HTML template files with a `.html` extension. These files can contain static HTML code along with placeholders for dynamic content.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Render Templates**: Use the `render_template()` function from Flask to render template files. This function takes the name of the template file as an argument and can also accept additional context variables to pass dynamic data to the template.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Use Jinja2 Syntax**: Within the template files, use Jinja2 syntax to insert dynamic content, include other templates, or execute control structures like loops and conditionals.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Pass Data to Templates**: Pass data from Flask routes to templates by using template variables. These variables can be accessed within the template using double curly braces `{{ }}`.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, consider a Flask route that renders a template and passes a variable `name`:\n",
